# real_time_location

This package manages all location-related features, it deals with the os to get one shot location or location stream, also the client of the [DriverLocationManager](https://github.com/sitatec/Taluxi-Open-Source/tree/main/backend/driver_location_manager) microservices is implemented on this repository. It uses Firebase real-time database to share the location in realtime. It sends the Driver location to the DriverLocationManager Every 1KM (1KM is a little bit long but it reduces the battery consumption and the server bandwidth), It will stop sending the location when the driver starts driving a client and will continue when the driver will be available again.
